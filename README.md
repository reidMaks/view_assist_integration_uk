# Welcome

Welcome to the long awaited, much anticipated View Assist integration!  

A HUGE thank you goes out to Mark Parker @msp1974 for his MASSIVE help with making this a reality.  Mark has written the majority of the integration with my guidance.  You should check out his [Home Assistant Integration Examples](https://github.com/msp1974/HAIntegrationExamples) Github if you are intestered in creating your own integration.  His work has propelled View Assist to first class in very short order.  We would not be where we are today without his continued efforts and the hours and hours he has put in to make View Assist better!  Thanks again Mark!
